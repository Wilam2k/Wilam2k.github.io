      Hello! I am William Sjöström. I have worked as a full-stack developer
      since 2021, with a broad skill set that includes solid knowledge in React,
      C#/.NET, Golang, TypeScript, and CSS, along with experience in UX/UI,
      Python, and Docker. <br /> I’ve been involved in predictive maintenance
      and the development of a condition monitoring system. My team managed both
      the front-end and back-end for data collection and reporting within the
      system. The system received various types of data, such as vibration
      measurements, temperature, sound, and responses to visual inspections,
      which were then analyzed. Based on the analysis, we generated reports with
      recommended actions as needed.
      <br /> I used TypeScript, React, and Golang to develop this system.
      Additionally, I used Cypress for end-to-end testing and Jest for unit
      tests. Alongside my role as a developer, I also took on the
      responsibilities of a Scrum Master.
      <br /> Thanks to my experience, I’ve become a competent full-stack
      developer, and my genuine interest in the field makes it easy for me to
      learn new technologies.
      <br /> I hold a bachelor’s degree in Innovative Programming from Linköping
      University, where I participated in several innovative projects with
      various companies. These projects involved technologies such as a
      geolocation app developed in React Native with expo.io and a system that
      visualized real-time data via OpenMCT.
      <br /> I am motivated by solving challenges in all areas, from work
      methodology to technical issues. I have a strong ability to transform user
      and customer needs into technical solutions. I want to make a difference
      and contribute. My strengths are transparency, adaptability, innovation,
      and a sense of responsibility.
      <br /> I thrive in an open work environment where there is space for both
      innovation and high ambition.
